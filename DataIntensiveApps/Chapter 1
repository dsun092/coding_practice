Chapter 1

3 primary concerns for any software:
1. reliability
    System should continue to work correctly even in the face of adversity
2. scalability
    As the system grows, there should be reasonable ways to deal with growth
3. maintainability
    Many different people will work on same code base. Should be easy to ramp up and understand

1. Relibaility
Its impossible to eliminate faults so we prefer fault-tolerant systems over fault-less systems.

Hardware Faults
Hard disks fail after around 10-50 years. On a cluster of 10K disks, thats about 1 failed disk per day.

Software Errors
1. software bugs that causes application to crash on bad input
2. runaway process
3. dependencies start failing
4. cascading failures

2. Scalability
