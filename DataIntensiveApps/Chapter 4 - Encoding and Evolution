Chapter 4 - Encoding and Evolution

REST and RPC
REST emphasizes simple data formats, using URLs for identifying resources and uses HTTP features for cache control, authe, and content type.

SOAP is an XML-based protocol for making network API requests which is usually done over HTTP but aims to be independent from HTTP. a SOAP web service will use WSDL to generate some client that calls local classes and method calls.

RPC - Remote Procedure Call
Tries to make a request to a remote network service look the same as calling a function or method in your programming language.
i.e dynamoDbClient.putObject(object)

This approach is fundamentally flawed however,
1. network call is unpredictable and response time may vary.
2. Local calls either succeed or throws an exception. Network calls can return without result because of timeout which means you don't know what happened.
3. If you retry a failed network requests, it could be that responses are failing to come back so you are making duplicate actions.

Message Brokers
When client sends messages, rather than sending directly to server you can put it into a message broker which distributes the message to servers.
1. Acts as a buffer if server is unavailable or overloaded.
2. Automatically redeliver messages to a process that has crashed
3. Avoids sender to know where to send message.
4. Logically decouples sender from recipients. Sender just publishes a messages and recipients can consume.
