Invert Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/

Invert a binary tree.

We can use recursion to traverse the tree and for a given node, we swap the left and right children.

1. if current node is null, return null
2. swap left and right child.
3. recurse down left and right tree.
4. return root.
