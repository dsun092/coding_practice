Subsets
https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/

Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).

Since we want to find all subsets from a given number, we use a back tracking approach which means we visit every permutation of the subsets.

Backtracking Algorithm
1. If we have reached past the array, exit.
2. Process current item that we are backtrack to
3. Add it to our stack
4. backtrack into it
5. pop it off our stack.
