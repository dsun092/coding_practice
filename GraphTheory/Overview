Overview

Common Graph Problems
1. shortest path
    1. BFS (unweighted graph)
    2. Dijkstra's
    3. Bellman=ford
    4. Floyd Warshall, etc

2. Connectivity (does there exist a path from node A to node B)
    1. Use union-find or DFS

3. Detecting negative cycles
    1. bellman-ford
    2. floyd-warshall

4. Strongly Connected Components
    1. Tarjan's and Kosaraju's

5. Finding bridges in a graph
    1. edges that when removed will increase number of connected components
6. Articulation points

7. Minimum Spanning Trees
    1. Kruskals
    2. Prims

8. Network flow: max flow
    1. Ford-fulkerson
    2. Edmonds-Karp
